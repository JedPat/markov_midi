# AI music generator

This AI algorithm was designed to generate new melodies based on the input ones.

Output MIDI files have to be instrumented in any DAW software to be heard.

It works only in the MATLAB software and has to be loaded into the MIDI Toolbox library (https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/miditoolbox).

It's free to use under the MIT license.

I tried to re-write it into the Python language using NumPy but it didn't work. To start transcription collaboration, feel free to contact me.
