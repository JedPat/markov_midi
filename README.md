# markov_midi
Symbolic Markov-chain-based music algorithm

The algorithm was designed to generate new algorithmic melodies markov-based on the input ones.

It works only in the MATLAB software and has to be loaded into MIDI Toolbox library (https://www.jyu.fi/hytk/fi/laitokset/mutku/en/research/materials/miditoolbox).

It's free to use under the MIT license.

I tried to re-write it into the Python language but it didn't work. To start transcription collaboration, feel free to contact me.
